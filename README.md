Certainly! Here's an updated version of the readme file for your Contact Manager API, including information about JWT authentication and error handling:

# Contact Manager API

The Contact Manager API is a RESTful API project built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient management of contact data. The API also incorporates JWT authentication for secure access and implements error handling for a smoother user experience.

## Features

- **Create**: Easily create new contacts by sending POST requests to the `/api/contacts` endpoint.
- **Read**: Retrieve contact data by making GET requests to the `/api/contacts` endpoint or retrieve specific contact details by accessing the `/contacts/:id` endpoint.
- **Update**: Update existing contacts using PUT requests to the `/api/contacts/:id` endpoint and specifying the necessary parameters.
- **Delete**: Delete contacts by sending DELETE requests to the `/api/contacts/:id` endpoint.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the API endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication, ensuring authorized access to protected resources.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms to provide informative error responses and enhance the user experience.

## Installation

To run the Contact Manager API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
4. Set up the MongoDB connection:
   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
   - Update the MongoDB connection details in the `server.js` file by modifying the `connection_string` variable.
5. Start the server by running the command: `npm start`.

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can use a tool like Postman or the Thunder Client extension in VS Code to test the endpoints.

## JWT Authentication

To access protected endpoints, you need to include a valid JWT token in the request headers. The token can be obtained by  middleware endpoint with valid login credentials. On successful login, the API will respond with a JWT token that can be used for subsequent requests by including it in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix.

## Error Handling

The Contact Manager API implements error handling to provide meaningful error responses in case of issues or invalid requests. The API will respond with appropriate status codes and error messages, allowing clients to handle errors effectively. Error responses include details such as the error message, status code, and additional information, helping users understand and resolve any encountered issues.
